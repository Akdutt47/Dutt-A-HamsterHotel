// I created the website Hamster Hotel based upon the example i was given to the best of my ability. I used HTML and CSS to make it look as much as I could to the example of the website we were given.
// Peer Review By: Mike Heckerman
// Peer Review: All the pieces are there, they just don't line up properly. There is clipping issues in most of the areas. Responsiveness is not really there.
